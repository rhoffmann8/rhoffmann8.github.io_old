  <h1>About</h1>

  <p>I write JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and PHP. I used to work with Java, C, and C++, but not lately.</p>
  <p>Framework-wise, I've worked with jQuery, ExtJS, Joomla, and Lumen on the job. I use React/Redux when working on personal projects. I used to run this site on the typical Jekyll setup for Github pages, but I recently rewrote the whole thing in Angular 1.4. I didn't see much point in learning Angular 1 with version 2 and its many changes looming, but according to <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">recruiters</span> people who do not have intimate knowledge of the field, if I don't know Angular, my years of JavaScript experience mean nothing.</p>

  <p>I have a B.S. and M.S. in Computer Science from <a href="https://www.stevens.edu/sit/">Stevens Institute of Technology</a>. Most of my development work there was done in C under a UNIX-like environment. My favorite project was implementing a full <a href="https://github.com/rhoffmann8/cs631/tree/master/sws">HTTP/1.0 web server</a>.

  <p>At present I work as a 50/50 (well, more like 80/20) front-end/PHP developer at a medium-sized marketing company. My tasks generally involve:
  
  <ul>
    <li>Building of microservices (usually backed by Lumen) to centralize common functionality across separate properties,</li>
    <li>JS/CSS/HTML development for said microservices when a frontend is required,</li>
    <li>Integration of modern UI build processes (Sass/Gulp/Webpack) to an otherwise aging codebase.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Other interests include music, good beer, and baseball. I am lifelong fan of the New York Mets (even after they <a href="http://nypost.com/2015/11/02/mets-lead-and-year-disappear-lose-gut-wrenching-world-series/">choked harder than I've seen in a long time</a>), and would appreciate nothing more than a World Series win during my lifetime. While I have not made much <a href="#/stadiums">progress</a> yet, I also plan to visit every team's home stadium at some point.</p>

  <p>Thanks for visiting! Please feel free to <a ng-controller="ContactCtrl" href="{{ (contact | filter:{service: 'mail'})[0].url }}">contact</a> me if you have any questions or concerns with anything you see here.</p>
