<p>This isn&#39;t so much a code tip as it is a friendly reminder to remember to specify your <code>Content-Type</code> header when making a HTTP request. Due to this, I recently ran into a interesting little issue at work.</p>
<p>We have a small web-based tool that allows developers to upload HTML5 games and test them against a dummy API. Over the past few days I was tasked with recreating the tool in Node.js (it&#39;s an old PHP-based page that needed some fixing up -- I reached the conclusion it would be much simpler to redo it). At certain points during play, the game would send a JSON request with various details: event type, token, game data, etc. To receive and process the request, I had a pretty standard-looking <a href="http://expressjs.com/">express</a> route using a JSON parser:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js">var express = require(<span class="hljs-string">'express'</span>)<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
var bodyParser = require(<span class="hljs-string">'body-parser'</span>)<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>

var app = express()<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
app.use(bodyParser.json())<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>

<span class="hljs-comment">//...</span>

app.post(<span class="hljs-string">'/events'</span>, function(req, res) {
  log(req.body)<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
  processEvent(req.body)<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>

  res.<span class="hljs-keyword">end</span>()<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
})<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>However, every time I triggered the appropriate action in the provided HTML5 game to send the request, <code>req.body</code> was empty! As an intermediate Node.js programmer I thought I had missed something simple or perhaps was using some deprecated parsing functionality by mistake. I checked the request payload to see if it was syntactically incorrect, but to no avail. After about a half hour of futility it occured to me to double check the request headers:</p>
<div class="row center">
  <div class="img-holder">
    <div class="img-holder-inner">
      <img src="/images/2015-08-04-content-type.png" style="width:280px;">
    </div>
    <p class="caption">
      Content-Type here is &quot;text/plain&quot; instead of &quot;application/json&quot;
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The game was not setting the <code>Content-Type</code> header to <strong>application/json</strong> -- instead it was <strong>text/plain</strong>. This made the bodyParser unable to parse it correctly.</p>
<p>In a perfect world this would be corrected in the game itself by setting the header correctly, but this being reality I knew I would not be able to fix the other hundreds of games that had the same issue. So, I had to settle for parsing the request in its raw form:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">getRequestPayload</span><span class="hljs-params">(req)</span> {</span>
  <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> new Promise(<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">(resolve, reject)</span> {</span>
    var str = <span class="hljs-string">''</span>;
    req.on(<span class="hljs-string">'data'</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">(buf)</span> {</span>
      str += buf;
    });
    req.on(<span class="hljs-string">'end'</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span> {</span>
      resolve(str);
    });
  });
}

app.post(<span class="hljs-string">'/events'</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">(req, res)</span> {</span>
  getRequestPayload(req)
    .<span class="hljs-keyword">then</span>(<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">(json)</span> {</span>
      var json = JSON.parse(json);

      <span class="hljs-built_in">log</span>(json);
      processEvent(json);

      res.<span class="hljs-keyword">end</span>();
    })
    .<span class="hljs-keyword">catch</span>(<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">(err)</span> {</span>
      <span class="hljs-built_in">log</span>(err);
      res.<span class="hljs-keyword">end</span>();
    });
});
</code></pre>
<p>If you&#39;re not familiar with <a href="https://promisesaplus.com/">promises</a> you should definitely check them out. In this particular instance I&#39;m using the <a href="https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird">Bluebird</a> promise library.</p>
<p>Hopefully this reminder will spare another developer the expense of having to work around this.</p>
