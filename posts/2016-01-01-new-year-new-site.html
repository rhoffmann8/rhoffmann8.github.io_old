<p>Happy 2016 to everyone. A lot&#39;s happened since the last update &mdash; some good, some bad, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/02/sports/baseball/kansas-city-royals-beat-new-york-mets-world-series-game-5.html">some that copious amounts of alcohol just can&#39;t seem to fix</a>.</p>
<p>I did away with the Jekyll setup for this site and wrote my own <a href="https://github.com/rhoffmann8/gh-page-source">build system</a> to run it on Angular 1.4. I would have used React instead (<code>ng-repeat</code> makes the <a href="/#/stadiums">Stadiums</a> page run pretty slow in IE), but I need to demonstrate basic competence in this framework or else I&#39;m apparently not a good web developer.</p>
<p>Hopefully I&#39;ll get around to posting more React and Redux stuff in the future. In the meantime you can check out my <a href="/#/projects">Projects</a> page to see some example React projects.</p>
