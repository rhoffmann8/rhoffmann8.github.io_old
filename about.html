<div class="about">
<p>Hello there. I created this small site in the hopes that cataloging my own insights and endeavors will also help those who may find themselves in similar positions. That, or just to talk about whatever.</p>
<p>I am a BS/MS Computer Science graduate of <a href="https://www.stevens.edu/sit/">Stevens Institute of Technology</a>. While there, much of my development experience was centered around C under the UNIX environment.</p>

<p>I currently work as a PHP developer (please don't hold it against me) at a medium-sized marketing company. Prior to my current position I was a primarily-JavaScript sometimes-Java developer in the telecoms industury. While my current work is mostly server-side implementation I enjoy coding JS and learning about new frameworks and other technologies on the side.</p>

<p>I am a lifelong fan of the New York Mets (please also don't hold that against me) and would appreciate nothing more than a World Series win during my lifetime.</p>

<p>Thanks for visiting! Please feel free to <a href="mailto:rhoffmann8@gmail.com">contact</a> me if you have any questions or concerns with anything you see here.</p>

<p>- Rob</p>
