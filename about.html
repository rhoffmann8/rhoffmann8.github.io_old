<div class="about">
<p>Hello! I created this small site in the hopes that cataloging my own insights and endeavors will also help those who may find themselves in similar positions. That, or just to talk about whatever.</p>
<p>I am a BS/MS Computer Science graduate of <a href="https://www.stevens.edu/sit/">Stevens Institute of Technology</a>. While there, much of my development experience was centered around C under the UNIX environment. My favorite coding project during my time there was implementing a full <a href="https://github.com/rhoffmann8/cs631/tree/master/sws">HTTP/1.0 web server</a> in C.</p>

<p>I currently work as a PHP developer at a medium-sized marketing company, though more recently I have found myself doing more Javascript & CSS coding in addition to working with build systems such as <a href="https://getcomposer.org/">Composer</a> and <a href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a> / <a href="http://gulpjs.com/">Gulp</a>. Prior to my current position I was a primarily-JavaScript sometimes-Java developer in the telecoms industry.</p>

<p>When not at work I enjoy coding JS and learning about new frameworks and other technologies on the side. I also love baseball and am a lifelong fan of the New York Mets. I would appreciate nothing more than a World Series win during my lifetime. While I have not made <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shea_Stadium">much</a> <a href="http://newyork.mets.mlb.com/nym/ballpark/">progress</a> <a href="http://atlanta.braves.mlb.com/atl/ballpark/">yet</a>, I also plan to visit every team's home stadium at some point.</p>

<p>Thanks for visiting! Please feel free to <a href="mailto:rhoffmann8@gmail.com">contact</a> me if you have any questions or concerns with anything you see here.</p>

<p>- Rob</p>
